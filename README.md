Web project for learning all the basics about javascript
What I've learned:
1. I had already known many aspects of ES6 before I started this project, so it was more of a way to show my skills to potential employer
2. Making async data request with Promis and other ways such as http.request fetch and other
3. Building UI with html,css,js also I reminded myself some DOM functional
4. Learned teamwork and collaborations with my project team
Overall, it was an interesting project but also felt like it was low difficalty, because it was way easier than some of my university projects.
